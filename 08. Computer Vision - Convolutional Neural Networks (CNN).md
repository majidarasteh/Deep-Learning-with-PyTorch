# Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs
Neural networks can be **fully connected** or **partially connected**. When a neural network is not fully connected, it is called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).In a **fully connected network**, every neuron in one layer is connected to **all neurons** in the previous layer. In contrast, in a **convolutional network**, each neuron in a layer is connected only to a **small region** of the neurons in the previous layer. This local connectivity allows CNNs to efficiently detect patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes, which is why **convolutional neural networks are widely used for image processing tasks**.
