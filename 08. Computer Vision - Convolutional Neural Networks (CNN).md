# Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs
Neural networks can be **fully connected** or **partially connected**. When a neural network is not fully connected, it is called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).In a **fully connected network**, every neuron in one layer is connected to **all neurons** in the previous layer. In contrast, in a **convolutional network**, each neuron in a layer is connected only to a **small region** of the neurons in the previous layer. This local connectivity allows CNNs to efficiently detect patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes, which is why **convolutional neural networks are widely used for image processing tasks**.

### Understanding Fully Connected vs. Convolutional Neural Networks

1. **Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNs)**
   In a fully connected neural network, also called a dense network, every neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. However, this structure becomes **inefficient for large inputs, such as images**, where each pixel would require its own connection. For example, an image of size 100Ã—100 pixels (10,000 values) connected to just one layer of 1,000 neurons would require 10 million connections. Example use: simple classification

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   To solve this problem, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were introduced. Instead of connecting each neuron to all inputs, CNNs connect each neuron only to a **small local region** of the input (called the **receptive field**). This means:
   * Each neuron processes only part of the input.
   * CNNs can detect **local features** such as edges, corners, and textures.
   * These local features are then combined in deeper layers to recognize **complex patterns** like objects or faces.

**CNN are useful for image processing and vision tasks.**
